# peacock-room-prototype
This is work done in 2019 and 2020 in support of an update to [*The Story of the Beautiful*](https://peacockroom.wayne.edu/about), a research collaboration between the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art, and Wayne State University’s Library System, supported in part with grants from the Smithsonian Web 2.0 Fund, the Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation for the Arts, and the Henry Luce Foundation. The original versions of the ["World Tours"](https://peacockroom.wayne.edu/world-tours) were done using StoryMapJS, and I was asked to prototype an update to these using LeafletJS and GeoJSON. This prototype, of the first of three World Tours, was tweaked by Maria Nuccilli and expanded out to the remaining two World Tours.
